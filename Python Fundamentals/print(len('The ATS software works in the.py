sa= ("One of the three practices that I am already doing is arriving and events early or on time. Although there are always exceptions and issues that I can encounter most of the time I am on time to these things. Another practice is that I respect others' times and schedules, I think I do it because I don't like people playing with my time, and being irresponsible with others' time. Lastly, I believe most of the time I present my best image, I try to stay groomed and dressed according to the situation. Although there are days in which I am not groomed or dressed accordingly, like I say I try most of the times to be like this.On the other hand, there are other things I would need to improve, for example, in Practicing professional oral communication, I feel like when I speak to somebody I can stutter a lot, and most of the time when I try to explain something, I need to get better at explaining and talk professionally. In addition, I believe I need to strengthen my ability to stay organized and determine priorities, most of the time I try to stay organized and determine priorities, but it is easy for me to fall out of track, making me disorganized and even sometimes almost to be late. I will probably need to come up with a system that could work for me. Lastly, developing a mastery of written business communications. Sometimes I think I don't know how to write in a professional way, I struggle sometimes with it. I could practice this by writing and comparing business letters and the techniques that people could have.")
